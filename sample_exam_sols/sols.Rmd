<!--------------------------- QUESTION 1
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Question 1

The file [at_health_facilities.csv](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/02/instructor-certification-exams/at_health_facilities.csv) contains a tidy dataset with four columns:

- The ISO3 code of the country that reported data.
- The year for which data was reported. 
- The percentage of HIV-positive children born to HIV-positive mothers age 15–17. 
- The percentage of HIV-positive children born to HIV-positive mothers age 20–34.

Please answer the following questions:

1. How many countries reported data?
2. What is the difference between the minimum and maximum year with valid data for each country?
3. How many countries reported data in 3 or more years?
4. Which countries reported 100% incidence for at least one year in either age group?

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

### Solutions to Question 1

```{r question_one}

# Read dataset.
hiv <- read_csv("../data/at_health_facilities.csv")

## Q1: How many countries reported data? 
## A1: 100 countries reported data.
length(unique(hiv$iso3))

## Q2: What is the difference between the minimum and maximum year with valid data for each country?
## A2: The difference set is the column `diff` below.
hiv %>%
  filter(is.numeric(`age 15-17`) | is.numeric(`age 20-34`)) %>%
  group_by(iso3) %>%
  summarise(diff = max(year) - min(year))

## Q3: How many countries reported data in 3 or more years?
## A3: 34 countries.
hiv %>%
  group_by(iso3) %>% 
  summarise(years_count = n_distinct(year)) %>%
  count(years_count >= 3)

## Q4: Which countries reported 100% incidence for at least one year in either age group?
## A4: 18 countries.
hiv %>%
  filter(`age 15-17` == 100 | `age 20-34` == 100) %>%
  distinct(iso3) %>%
  count()

```

<!--------------------------- QUESTION 2
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Question 2

A student has sent you the file [rmd-country-profile.Rmd](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020-01-20-instructor-certification-exams/rmd-country-profile.Rmd), which is an R Markdown document analyzing the data in [at_health_facilities.csv](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/02/instructor-certification-exams/at_health_facilities.csv) for Bangladesh. They could not knit the file, and are providing you with the raw .Rmd file instead of a rendered file.

1. Go through the file, fixing things that are preventing it from knitting cleanly.
2. Change the two lines of bold text to H2-level headers to organize the document, and add a table of contents.
3. Convert this R Markdown report for Bangladesh into a parameterized report with the country's iso3 code as its parameter. Knit a new country profile for Egypt (ISO3 code "EGY").

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

### Solutions to Question 2

1. There are four errors in the RMarkdown file:
    
    1. Line 3: Add missing `:` to `output`, i.e., line 3 should read `output:`. Also, hit tab on line 4 since yaml is sensitive to identation.
    2. Line 9: To set knitting options, use the `set` function, i.e., line 9 should read: `knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)`.
    3. Lines 57 \& 68: There are two chuncks with the same name `plot`. You can fix this by changing the name of one of such chuncks or simply getting rid of the names completely.
    4. Lines 60-62: The correct operator is `+` instead of `%>%`.

2. Change bold text of lines 15 & 46 by replacing `**` to `##`. To add a table of contents, add `toc: TRUE` to the yaml setting at the top of the document. The top of the RMarkdown file should look like:

    ```r
    ---
    title: "Country Profile"
    output:
      html_document:
        theme: flatly
        toc: TRUE
    ---
    ```

3. Add the `params` option to the yaml with a variable to store the parametrized country code:

    ```r
    params:
      country_code: "BGD"
    ```
and update `my_iso3 <- "BGD"` (it should now be on line 39) to use this new variable, i.e., `my_iso3 <- params$country_code`. To knit with a new parameter, you can go to the **Knit** dropdown in the IDE and click **Knit with Parameters** or run
  
    ```r
    rmarkdown::render("rmd-country-profile.Rmd", params = list(
      country_code = "EGY"
    ))
    ```

The completely fixed RMarkdown is at [data/fixed_rmd-country-profile.Rmd](../data/fixed_rmd-country-profile.Rmd).

<!--------------------------- QUESTION 3
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Question 3

You have been given a CSV file [infant_hiv.csv](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/02/instructor-certification-exams/infant_hiv.csv) that is formatted as follows:

- The first column is ISO3 country codes.
- There are three columns for each year from 2009 to 2017. Each set has estimated, low, and high values for the year (in that order).
- A dash `-` indicates that no data is available.
- Our analyst tells us that `>95%` means "the data is unreliable".

Your task is to turn this into a tidy data table for further analysis:

1. Describe what columns a tidy layout for this data would have and why.
2. Write a function that takes the name of a file containing this table as input and returns a tidy version of the table.
    - The function should replace all `-` and `>95%` values with `NA`.
    - The body of the function may contain one or more pipelines and may create temporary or intermediate variables, but may not contain any loops.

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

### Solutions to Question 4

1. An approach to have a tidy layout for our data is to convert all the columns but ISO3 into three new columns `year`, `stat`, and `value`. The `stat` column contains `hi`, `low`, or `est`.

2. The function `tidy_data` implements the approach on part 1.

```{r question_three}

tidy_data <- function(file){
  
  # Read data.
  raw_data <- read_csv(file) 
  
  # Tidy data by splitting the columns using a regex expression.
  tidy <- raw_data %>%
    pivot_longer(-ISO3,
                 names_to = c("year", "stat"),
                 names_pattern = "(.*) (.*)") %>%
    mutate(value = case_when(
      value == "-" | value == ">95%" ~ NA_character_,
      TRUE ~ str_replace(value, pattern = "%", replacement = "")
    ))
  
  # Return our tidy data.
  tidy
}

# Set data name/location.
file <- "../data/infant_hiv.csv"

# Call our function to tidy data.
tidy_data(file)

```

<!--------------------------- QUESTION 4
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Question 4

The file ranking.csv contains two columns:

- The ID of an item being rated.
- A rating, which is one of "negative", "positive", "indifferent", or "wtf" (meaning the respondent didn't understand the question).

There are multiple ratings for each item. The plot below shows this data:

- Each dot represents one item i.
- The size of the circles shows the total number of ratings for item i.
- The X coordinate for item i is the percentage of ratings for that item that are "negative".
- The Y coordinate for item i is the percentage of ratings for that item that are "positive".
- The regression line is created using the 'lm' method.

Re-create this plot using the tidyverse and ggplot2, fixing any mistakes you notice along the way.


<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

### Solutions to Question 4

```{r question_four, message = FALSE}

# Read data.
raw_data <- read_csv("../data/ranking.csv")

# Tidy data to ease plotting.
rankings <- raw_data %>%
  group_by(item) %>%
  count(rank) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = rank, values_from = n) %>%
  mutate(total = sum(positive, negative, indifferent, wtf, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(-item, -total), .funs = list(~ round(./total, digits = 2)))

# Reproduce given plot.
ggplot(rankings, aes(x = negative, y = positive, size = total)) +
  geom_point(aes(alpha = 0.25)) +
  geom_smooth(method='lm')

```
