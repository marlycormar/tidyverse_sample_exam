![](images/logos.png)
:::


The Tidyverse Certification is provided by RStudio and it attests to
your pedagogical skills and knowledge of the Tidyverse ecosystem. To
obtain the certification, the first step is to participate in a one-day
training course that focuses on teaching methodologies. The second step
is to pass two exams: a teaching exam and a Tidyverse exam. Below you will 
find solutions to the Tidyverse sample example provided by RStudio.

For more information on how to get certified, you can navigate to the
[trainers](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/) site.

<!--------------------------- QUESTION 1
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

### Question 1

The file
[at_health_facilities.csv](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/02/instructor-certification-exams/at_health_facilities.csv)
contains a tidy dataset with four columns:

- The ISO3 code of the country that reported data.
- The year for which data was reported. 
- The percentage of HIV-positive children born to HIV-positive mothers age
15–17.
- The percentage of HIV-positive children born to HIV-positive mothers age
20–34.

Please answer the following questions:

1. How many countries reported data?
2. What is the difference between the minimum and maximum year with valid
data for each country?
3. How many countries reported data in 3 or more years?
4. Which countries reported 100% incidence for at least one year in either age
group?

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

#### Solution to Question 1

```{r question_one}

# Read dataset.
hiv <- read_csv("../data/at_health_facilities.csv")

## Q1: How many countries reported data? 
## A1: 100 countries reported data.
length(unique(hiv$iso3))

## Q2: What is the difference between the minimum and maximum year with valid
## data for each country?
## A2: The difference set is the column `diff` below.
hiv %>%
  filter(is.numeric(`age 15-17`) | is.numeric(`age 20-34`)) %>%
  group_by(iso3) %>%
  summarise(diff = max(year) - min(year))

## Q3: How many countries reported data in 3 or more years?
## A3: 34 countries.
hiv %>%
  group_by(iso3) %>% 
  summarise(years_count = n_distinct(year)) %>%
  count(years_count >= 3)

## Q4: Which countries reported 100% incidence for at least one year in either
## age group?
## A4: 18 countries.
hiv %>%
  filter(`age 15-17` == 100 | `age 20-34` == 100) %>%
  distinct(iso3) %>%
  count()

```

<!--------------------------- QUESTION 2
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

### Question 2

A student has sent you the file
[rmd-country-profile.Rmd](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020-01-20-instructor-certification-exams/rmd-country-profile.Rmd),
which is an R Markdown document analyzing the data in [at_health_facilities.csv](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/02/instructor-certification-exams/at_health_facilities.csv)
for Bangladesh. They could not knit the file, and are providing you with the
raw .Rmd file instead of a rendered file.

1. Go through the file, fixing things that are preventing it from knitting
cleanly.
2. Change the two lines of bold text to H2-level headers to organize the
document, and add a table of contents.
3. Convert this R Markdown report for Bangladesh into a parameterized report
with the country's iso3 code as its parameter. Knit a new country profile for
Egypt (ISO3 code "EGY").

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

#### Solution to Question 2

1. There are four errors in the RMarkdown file:
    
    1. Line 3: Add missing `:` to `output`, i.e., line 3 should read `output:`.
    Also, hit tab on line 4 since yaml is sensitive to identation.
    2. Line 9: To set knitting options, use the `set` function, i.e., line 9
    should read: `knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)`.
    3. Lines 57 \& 68: There are two chuncks with the same name `plot`. You can
    fix this by changing the name of one of such chuncks or simply getting rid
    of the names completely.
    4. Lines 60-62: The correct operator is `+` instead of `%>%`.

2. Change bold text of lines 15 & 46 by replacing `**` to `##`. To add a table
of contents, add `toc: TRUE` to the yaml options at the top of the RMarkdown
file. It should now look as follows.

    ```r
    ---
    title: "Country Profile"
    output:
      html_document:
        theme: flatly
        toc: TRUE
    ---
    ```

3. Add `params` to the yaml options, specifying a variable name to store the
country code:

    ```r
    params:
      country_code: "BGD"
    ```
  and update `my_iso3 <- "BGD"` (it should now be on line 39) to use this new
  variable, i.e., `my_iso3 <- params$country_code`. To knit with a new
  parameter, you can go to the **Knit** dropdown in the IDE and click
  **Knit with Parameters** or alternatively, you can run the code below.

    ```r
    rmarkdown::render("rmd-country-profile.Rmd", params = list(
      country_code = "EGY"))
    ```

The completely fixed RMarkdown is at
[data/fixed_rmd-country-profile.Rmd](../data/fixed_rmd-country-profile.Rmd).

<!--------------------------- QUESTION 3
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

### Question 3

You have been given a CSV file
[infant_hiv.csv](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/02/instructor-certification-exams/infant_hiv.csv)
that is formatted as follows:

- The first column is ISO3 country codes.
- There are three columns for each year from 2009 to 2017. Each set has
estimated, low, and high values for the year (in that order).
- A dash `-` indicates that no data is available.
- Our analyst tells us that `>95%` means "the data is unreliable".

Your task is to turn this into a tidy data table for further analysis:

1. Describe what columns a tidy layout for this data would have and why.
2. Write a function that takes the name of a file containing this table as
input and returns a tidy version of the table.
    - The function should replace all `-` and `>95%` values with `NA`.
    - The body of the function may contain one or more pipelines and may create
    temporary or intermediate variables, but may not contain any loops.

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

#### Solution to Question 3

1. An approach to have a tidy layout for our data is to collapse all the
columns but ISO3 into three new columns `year`, `stats`, and `value`. The
`stats` column may contain the values `hi`, `low`, or `est`.

2. The function `tidy_data` implements the approach on part 1.

```{r question_three}

tidy_data <- function(file){
  
  # Read data.
  raw_data <- read_csv(file) 
  
  # Tidy data by splitting the columns using a regex expression.
  tidy <- raw_data %>%
    pivot_longer(-ISO3,
                 names_to = c("year", "stats"),
                 names_pattern = "(.*) (.*)") %>%
    mutate(value = case_when(
      value == "-" | value == ">95%" ~ NA_character_,
      TRUE ~ str_replace(value, pattern = "%", replacement = "")
    ))
  
  # Return tidy data.
  tidy
}

# Set data file name/location.
file <- "../data/infant_hiv.csv"

# Tidy data by calling the function we just created.
tidy_data(file)

```

<!--------------------------- QUESTION 4
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

### Question 4

The file
[ranking.csv](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/02/instructor-certification-exams/ranking.csv)
contains two columns:

- The ID of an item being rated.
- A rating, which is one of "negative", "positive", "indifferent", or "wtf"
(meaning the respondent didn't understand the question).

There are multiple ratings for each item. The plot below shows this data:

- Each dot represents one item i.
- The size of the circles shows the total number of ratings for item i.
- The X coordinate for item i is the percentage of ratings for that item that
are "negative".
- The Y coordinate for item i is the percentage of ratings for that item that
are "positive".
- The regression line is created using the 'lm' method.

Re-create this plot using the tidyverse and ggplot2, fixing any mistakes you
notice along the way.


<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

#### Solution to Question 4

```{r question_four, echo=TRUE, message = FALSE}

# Read data.
raw_data <- read_csv("../data/ranking.csv")

# Tidy data to ease plotting.
rankings <- raw_data %>%
  group_by(item) %>%
  count(rank) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = rank, values_from = n) %>%
  mutate(num = sum(positive, negative, indifferent, wtf, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(-item, -num), .funs = list(~ round(./num, digits = 2)))

# Reproduce given plot.
ggplot(rankings, aes(x = negative, y = positive, size = num)) +
  geom_point(aes(alpha = 0.25)) +
  geom_smooth(method='lm')

```
